# LudoAI

This is an implementation of genetic algoriths for playing the game LUDO in python, based on the ludoPy packages.
https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy

The population class handles the evolutionary computation, it is used to generate a populations of the agent class, evaluate the population for a set amount of games, compute the fitness (win rate), perform selection, cross-over and mutation, before replacing the current generation and start over with a, hopefully, improved new generation.

# Examples
## Evaluate my best player against random/your player:
```python
import ludopy
import numpy as np
from agent import Agent

# Parameters
numGames = 50
numEnemys = 3 # 1 for 1v1 game (2 player game), 3 for 4 player game
numAgents = 1 

# Setup Philips best agent
# Player trained with following parameters
# Population size: 50
# Games pr. generation: 500
# Mutation rate: 0.1
# Mutation size: 0.5 (gene = gene + random.uniform(-mutationSize, mutationSize))
# Elitism: 10%
# Number of generations: 250
